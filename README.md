# SEC-Filings-Options-Data-Collecter
Automatically scrape stock options data and cumulatively compile into an excel file using R. 
Make sure to change your working directory.

The code in this project compiles stock options contract filings, filters tickers by volume, and then automatically creates charts of the performance of a stock.
The time series chart is aggregated over a couple months.

Below is a screenshot of one of the several PDFs that show stock return pre-filing (of stock option contracts.)

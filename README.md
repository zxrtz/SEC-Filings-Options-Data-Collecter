# SEC-Filings-Options-Data-Collecter
Automatically scrape stock options data and cumulatively compile into an excel file using R. 
Make sure to change your working directory.

The code in this project compiles stock options contract filings, filters tickers by volume, and then automatically creates charts of the performance of a stock.
The time series chart is aggregated over a couple months.

Below is a screenshot of one of the several PDFs that show stock return pre-filing (of stock option contracts.) Further in this page, you can also see the PDFs that were automatically compiled onto a local directory. This can also be done via cloud service in order to continuously pull up stock charts of tickers that recently had important option filings.
